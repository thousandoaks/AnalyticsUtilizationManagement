        "## About Medicare \n",
        "\n",
        "In the United States, Medicare is a single-payer, national social insurance program administered by the U.S. federal government since 1966. United States Medicare is funded by a payroll tax, premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries, and general revenue. It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax. It also provides health insurance to younger people with some disability status as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as people with end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2015, Medicare provided health insurance for over **55 million** (46 million people age 65 and older and 9 million younger people). On average, Medicare covers about half of the health care charges for those enrolled. The enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental insurance, separate insurance, or out-of-pocket. Out-of-pocket costs can vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs. \n",
        "\n",
        "## About CMS\n",
        "\n",
        "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), previously known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. In addition to these programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care facilities (more commonly referred to as nursing homes) through its survey and certification process, clinical laboratory quality standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and oversight of HealthCare.gov.\n",
        "\n",
        "## About the Data-Set\n",
        "\n",
        "This [public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/cms-medicare) was created by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The data summarizes the utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers. The dataset includes the following data: Common inpatient and outpatient services, All physician and other supplier procedures and services, All Part D prescriptions. Providers determine what they will charge for items, services, and procedures provided to patients and these charges are the amount that providers bill for an item, service, or procedure.\n",
